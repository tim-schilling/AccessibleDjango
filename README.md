AccessibleDjango is a Django package focused on checking your web applications for accessibility compliance. It ensures your app adheres to accessibility standards, making your web interfaces usable for everyone, including individuals with disabilities. AccessibleDjango currently checks for missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags, with plans for further accessibility features in future releases.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Accessibility Checks**:  
  Automatically evaluates views and templates for common accessibility issues, such as missing or empty `alt` attributes in `<img>` tags.  

- **Detailed Reports**:  
  Generates comprehensive accessibility reports highlighting issues found in your templates and views.  

- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:  
  Easily integrate AccessibleDjango into your project and CI pipelines.  

- **Customizable Rules**:

AccessibleDjango currently focuses exclusively on checking `alt` attributes for `<img>` tags. Future releases may include features such as:  
- Prebuilt accessible templates.
